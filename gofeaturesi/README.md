Concepts

  - defer
  --  stacking, evaluation of arguments
  - panic
  - recover
  - basic errors (again)

Introduction material:
 
- https://gobyexample.com/panic
- tour.golang.org -> Flow control  > defer
- tour.golang.org -> Flow control  > stacking defers
- https://gobyexample.com/defer

Task:
- Write example with panic, defer and recover (perhaps with divide by zero, or with file, err := os.Open(os.Args[1]) ? ) and observe the flow
